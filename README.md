# Login Page and User Management DB

## ‚úîÔ∏è Requirements

| ID         | Requirement     |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1 | Use a database to store user information securely |
| 2 | Implement password hashing and salting for enhanced security |
| 3 | Use GraphQL for communication between the front end and back-end |
| 4 | Provide a user-friendly interface for registration, login and logout  |
| 5 | Style the login sytem using CSS to make it visually appealing and responsive  |
| 6 | Lock the user out of the account after 5 incorrect login attempts |
| 7 | Ensure good user experience by providing loading indicators during API requests |

## üíæ Back-end Solution

### Database Solution 

To address requirement 1 a connection is establised to a local MongoDB database using mongoose on a nodejs server. 

### GraphQL Solution

To meet requirement 3 the Mongoose MongoDB connection is then mapped to a GraphQL schema of type 'User'. This user type holds an ID, username, email, password, last login attempt time and failed login attempts count to support account lockouts. Two resolvers are also created for the GraphQL connection to the DB, one for registering new users and another for logging in. Apollo provider has been used to handle both thr GraphQL API calls between front-end / back-end and state management.

### Security Solution

Requirement 2 is met within the resolvers. The resolver for registering a new user uses bcrypt to apply a hash and salt the password. Bcrypt is also used within the login resolver to compare the hash of the password provided by the user when attempting to login and the hash stored in the database.

Requirement 6 is met within the login resolver. Each time a login attempt is made, the amount of previous incorrect attempts is checked before verifying the password provided. The amount of attempts is also incremented every time an incorrect password is provided. The time of the last attempt is also stored so that the user is only locked out for 5 minutes.

## üíª Front-end solution

### React solution

To meet requirement 4, a React front-end has been implemented. The front-end contains an index page that renders an App component.Either the Registration or Login component depending on which link has been selected in the navbar. Since Apollo is used for state management the index page has an Apollo wrapper around the main App component.

### Presentation

Requirement 5 is met by using bootstrap for layout and styling. This includes using the bootstrap Navbar and Form components. Requirement 7 is also met by introducing a loading state boolean that is updated depending on if the front-end is getting data from the back-end and conditionally displaying a loading message / loading icon to the user.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the solution

To run the solution a MongoDB named "authdb" with the collection "users" must be created and running.

From within the nodejs-backend directory run:

```
node server.js
```

From within the react-frontend directory run:

```
npm start
```

To access the application go to localhost:3001

# Next Steps

I only had a few hours over the weekend to work on this so the next steps would be to:
* Move the user authentication logic to an authentication service to reduce code duplication
* Provide the users details on the profile page
* Provide the login status on the navbar and move the log out button to the navbar
